Her research explores the use of EEG to investigate neural correlates, specifically for rare genetic diseases and those with neurodevelopmental disorders (such as Batten disease and Rett syndrome). Her goal is to understand how neurodevelopmental disorders impact sensorimotor function, cognitive function, and perceptual function in a noninvasive and unbiased manner, ultimately aiding in tracking of disease progression and understanding the effect of therapeutic interventions.

She is known for her research in homeostasis and neural circuit plasticity, where her team discovered synaptic scaling, the mechanism that maintains the constant firing rates of action potentials. Some of her current research includes studying how homeostatic mechanisms react and interact with typical synaptic plasticity such as LTP and LTD."
